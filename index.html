          <h2>A unique student project in Antwerp</h2>
          <p>
            We are pleased to offer you this small-scale investment project of
            16 student rooms, located in the vibrant heart of the university
            area of ​​Antwerp.
          </p><br>
          <p>
            Antwerp, the second largest student city in Flanders after Ghent,
            currently has more than <b>500,000 inhabitants</b> and welcomes more than
            <b>60,000 students.</b> The demand for student rooms in the city continues
            to rise year after year. For example, in 2023, 10% more students
            chose a room than the year before. However, this growing demand has
            not led to a similar increase in supply, resulting in both a
            qualitative and quantitative shortage of student housing.
          </p><br>
          <p>
            Centre.1 is a stylish building that is equipped with all modern
            comforts and meets the contemporary standards and requirements of

            want to contribute to tackling the acute shortage of student rooms. <br>
